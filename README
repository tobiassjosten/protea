WHAT IS PROTEA?

Protea is a gaming enhancement system tailored for Iron Realms Entertainment
MUDs. Its primary aim is to ease gameplay and make it easier for both newcomers
and more seasoned players to immerse themselves in the wonderful worlds of IRE.

Protea acts as a middle man between the player and the game server, where it
tracks commands sent by the player and output recieved from the server. The
inner workings are quite complex, using advanced algorithms for artificial
intelligence to become aware of the environment and predict events.

Luckily, one of the key focuses is to hide all of this from the user, to allow
her to do what matters in the world - play the game.

This is an open source project licenced under the GNU General Public License.



HOW DO I USE PROTEA?

Protea requires MUSHclient, which can be found at http://www.gammon.com.au/.

1) Download Protea. Currently there are no releases, so cloning the Git repo is
   the preferred way of downloading.

2) Load the plugin in MUSHclient. Go to File -> Plugins and then click the Add
   button. Go to where you downloaded Protea and select protea.xml. Click Open.

3) Enjoy!

Currently Protea is available only as a MUSHclient plugin. However, it is being
architectured in such a way that writing adapters also for other clients will
be possible in the future.
